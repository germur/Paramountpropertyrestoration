## **FAQ (Optimized with PAA)**

**What causes basement flooding?**  
 Common causes include heavy rains, poor drainage, foundation cracks, burst pipes, or failed sump pumps.

**Can a flooded basement be saved?**  
 Yes. With fast pump-out and drying, most basements can be restored. Delays increase risks of mold and foundation damage.

**Do I need a sump pump installed?**  
 For flood-prone basements, a sump system with backup power is strongly recommended to prevent future flooding.

**How long does basement drying take?**  
 Typically 2–5 days depending on water volume and humidity levels. Continuous monitoring ensures safe results.

**Does insurance cover basement flooding?**  
 Coverage depends on the source—sudden leaks may be covered, but floodwater often requires separate flood insurance.
