## **❓ FAQ (Ceiling Water Damage)**

**How do I know if ceiling water damage is serious?**  
 Look for sagging, discoloration, musty odors, or peeling paint. These signal hidden water issues.

**Can I just paint over ceiling stains?**  
 No. Without fixing the leak source, stains and mold will return.

**How long does it take to repair ceiling water damage?**  
 Small repairs: 1–2 days. Major restoration: up to a week.

**Can water-damaged ceilings collapse?**  
 Yes. Untreated damage weakens drywall & beams, raising collapse risk.
