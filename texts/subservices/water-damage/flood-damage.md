## **FAQ (Optimized with PAA)**

**How long does flood cleanup take?**  
 Most properties dry within 2–5 days depending on water levels and building materials. Continuous monitoring ensures safe humidity levels before restoration begins.

 Coverage varies—flooding from storms often requires separate flood insurance. Most policies cover sudden water events. We assist with documentation for your claim.

**Can a flooded home be saved?**  
 Yes. With rapid extraction and drying, most structures can be stabilized and restored. Delays increase risks of mold and structural loss.

**What should I do first after a flood?**  
 Stay safe, shut off electricity if needed, and call for emergency water removal. Avoid entering rooms with standing water.

**What happens if flood water isn’t removed quickly?**  
 Mold, structural damage, and electrical hazards escalate within days, turning small repairs into major reconstruction.
