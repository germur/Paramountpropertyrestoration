**H1:** Mold Mitigation Services in Florida

**Intro (SEO \+ pirámide invertida):**  
 Mold mitigation is about **prevention and containment**—stopping mold from spreading, controlling humidity, and protecting your property until full remediation can safely remove it.  
 Unlike remediation, which eliminates colonies, mitigation is the **first line of defense** against contamination and health risks.
