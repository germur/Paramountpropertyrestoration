**H1:** Storm Damage Mitigation Services in Florida

**Intro (SEO \+ pirámide invertida):**  
 Storms and hurricanes don’t just cause immediate destruction—they leave homes and businesses **exposed to secondary damage** like flooding, mold, and structural collapse.  
 Storm mitigation focuses on **securing and stabilizing** your property right after impact. Unlike restoration, which repairs and rebuilds, mitigation prevents additional loss while you prepare for full recovery.
