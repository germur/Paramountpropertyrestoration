## **FAQs (Optimized)**

**How fast should water damage restoration start?**  
 Ideally within 24 hours. Early extraction and drying reduce structural damage and the risk of mold growth.

**What does the water damage process include?**  
 Our process includes: emergency inspection & moisture mapping, water extraction, cleaning & sanitizing, odor control, repairs, and finish restoration.

**Do you handle floods, leaks, and burst pipes?**  
 Yes. We respond to storm flooding, appliance failures, roof leaks, slab leaks, and burst supply lines.

**Can you prevent mold after water damage?**  
 Yes. We control humidity, remove wet materials when needed, and apply antimicrobial treatments to prevent mold.

**How long does structural drying take?**  
 Typically 2–5 days, depending on materials, saturation, ventilation, and indoor humidity. We monitor progress daily.

**Will my insurance cover water damage?**  
 Many policies cover sudden or accidental water events. Flood damage may require separate coverage. We assist with documentation for your claim.

**What items can be saved after water damage?**  
 Non-porous items often clean well. Porous materials like carpet padding, insulation, and MDF may need replacement based on contamination level.
