## How Does Exposure Happen?

Understanding the three primary exposure pathways helps identify risks and prevent further health impacts.

### 🌬️ Inhalation (Most Common Route)

**The Primary and Most Dangerous Exposure Method**

Breathing mold spores is by far the most frequent way people are affected:

**How It Happens:**
- Microscopic spores become airborne during daily activities
- Opening doors, walking on carpet, or HVAC operation disperses spores
- Particles are small enough (2-10 microns) to reach deep into lungs
- Can remain airborne for hours or even days

**Health Impacts:**
- Immediate allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
- Long-term sensitization (developing allergies over time)
- Mycotoxin exposure causing systemic illness
- Lung infections in immunocompromised individuals

**Common Indoor Sources:**
- HVAC systems with hidden growth spreading spores throughout the home
- [Water-damaged](/restoration/water-damage) walls, especially behind drywall
- [Ceiling water damage](/restoration/water-damage/ceiling-water-damage) from roof leaks
- [Basement flooding](/restoration/water-damage/basement-flooding) creating hidden growth
- Carpets and padding after [flood damage](/restoration/water-damage/flood-damage)
- Bathroom and kitchen areas with poor ventilation

If you suspect airborne mold, [professional air quality testing](/restoration/mold-remediation/mold-testing) measures spore concentrations and identifies dangerous species.

### 🍽️ Ingestion (Less Common but Serious)

**Food and Water Contamination**

While less frequent than inhalation, ingestion of mycotoxins poses serious health risks:

**Exposure Routes:**
- Eating moldy foods (bread, fruits, nuts, grains, cheese)
- Contaminated drinking water from moldy plumbing
- Cross-contamination from moldy surfaces to food preparation areas
- Children and pets ingesting mold from contaminated toys or objects

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Mycotoxins enter digestive system directly
- Can cause acute food poisoning symptoms
- May lead to long-term organ damage (liver, kidneys)
- Particularly dangerous for children and immunocompromised individuals

**Prevention Steps:**
- Discard moldy foods immediately (don't just cut off moldy parts)
- Clean refrigerators and pantries regularly
- Address [water damage](/restoration/water-damage) near kitchens promptly
- Never salvage moldy porous materials
- Use HEPA vacuum during cleanup to prevent spore spread

### 🖐️ Skin Contact (Direct Exposure)

**Dermal Reactions from Touch**

Touching moldy surfaces or materials can cause immediate or delayed reactions:

**Common Reactions:**
- Immediate allergic responses (hives, redness, swelling)
- Contact dermatitis from mycotoxins
- Skin infections from scratching irritated areas
- Sensitization leading to more severe future reactions

**High-Risk Activities:**
- Cleaning visible mold without proper protective equipment
- Handling water-damaged materials during cleanup
- Working in contaminated crawl spaces, attics, or basements
- Touching walls or surfaces with hidden growth
- DIY mold removal attempts

**Protection During Exposure:**
Professional [mold remediation](/restoration/mold-remediation) uses proper containment, protective equipment (gloves, suits, respirators), and specialized cleaning methods to prevent exposure during cleanup. Never attempt to remove significant mold growth yourself.
