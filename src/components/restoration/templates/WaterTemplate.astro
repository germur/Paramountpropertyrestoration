        { q: "What is water damage restoration?", a: "Water damage restoration is the process of cleaning, drying, and repairing property after water intrusion from floods, leaks, or storms. Our certified technicians use industrial-grade equipment to extract water, dry affected areas, and prevent secondary damage like mold growth." },
        { q: "How quickly should water damage restoration start?", a: "Ideally within 24 hours. Early extraction and drying reduce structural damage and the risk of mold growth. The longer water sits, the more expensive and extensive the restoration becomes." },
        { q: "What does the water damage process include?", a: "Our process includes: emergency inspection & moisture mapping, water extraction, cleaning & sanitizing, odor control, repairs, and finish restoration. We follow IICRC standards throughout the entire process." },
        { q: "Do you handle floods, leaks, and burst pipes?", a: "Yes. We respond to storm flooding, appliance failures, roof leaks, slab leaks, and burst supply lines. Our 24/7 emergency response team is equipped to handle any water damage scenario." },
        { q: "Will my insurance cover water damage restoration?", a: "Most homeowner's policies cover sudden water damage from burst pipes or appliance failures. Flood damage typically requires separate flood insurance. We work directly with insurance companies and help with claims documentation." },
        { q: "How long does the water damage restoration process take?", a: "The timeline varies depending on the extent of damage. Minor water damage can be resolved in 2-3 days, while major flooding may take 1-2 weeks. We provide detailed timelines during our initial assessment." }
