          a: "Water damage restoration is the process of cleaning, drying, and repairing property after water intrusion from floods, leaks, or storms. Our certified technicians use industrial-grade equipment to extract water, dry affected areas, and prevent secondary damage like mold growth.",
        },
        {
          q: "How quickly should water damage restoration start?",
          a: "Ideally within 24 hours. Early extraction and drying reduce structural damage and the risk of mold growth. The longer water sits, the more expensive and extensive the restoration becomes.",

        {
          q: "What does the water damage process include?",

        },
        {
          q: "Will my insurance cover water damage restoration?",

          q: "How long does the water damage restoration process take?",

          <p>
            Recognizing {sub?.title || group.name.toLowerCase()} early is crucial
            for preventing extensive property damage. Look for water stains on ceilings
            or walls, musty odors that indicate hidden moisture, warped flooring
            or baseboards, and unexplained increases in your water bill. In Florida's
            humid climate, even small leaks can quickly escalate into major restoration
            projects.
