  faqs: [
    { q: 'How do I know if I have mold in my Florida home?', a: 'Common signs include musty odors, visible black/green spots on walls or ceilings, increased humidity, and allergy-like symptoms (sneezing, headaches). Professional inspection with moisture mapping and lab testing confirms presence, type, and concentration levels.' },
    { q: 'Is black mold dangerous to my family?', a: 'Certain mold species (like Stachybotrys) can trigger respiratory issues, allergies, and other health problems, especially in children and sensitive individuals. We use strict PPE protocols, containment barriers, and HEPA filtration to remove it safely.' },
    { q: 'What does professional mold remediation include?', a: 'Our comprehensive process includes: (1) Thorough inspection, moisture mapping & lab testing, (2) Containment barriers & negative air pressure with HEPA filtration, (3) Safe removal of contaminated materials & deep cleaning, (4) Antimicrobial treatment & moisture source correction, (5) Final clearance testing.' },
    { q: 'Do you test for mold before and after remediation?', a: 'Yes, absolutely. Pre-remediation testing identifies mold types and concentrations to determine scope of work. Post-remediation clearance testing by an independent lab verifies successful removal and confirms safe indoor air quality levels.' },
    { q: 'How long does mold remediation take in Florida?', a: 'Most residential projects take 2-5 days depending on affected area size, materials involved, and humidity levels. Large commercial projects or extensive contamination may take 1-2 weeks. Florida\'s climate requires extra drying time.' },
    { q: 'Will mold come back after remediation?', a: 'Not if the underlying moisture source is properly fixed. We address root causes like leaks, poor ventilation, or humidity issues. We also recommend maintaining indoor humidity below 60% and provide ongoing prevention strategies specific to Florida homes.' }
